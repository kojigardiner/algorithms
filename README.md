# Algorithms & Data Structures

This repository contains the following:
- C implementations of the algorithms and data structures detailed in the Algorithms 4th ed. textbook by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne. The textbook implementations are in Java, and I found porting them to C offered a chance to better understand their details.
- Test clients inspired by the textbook for some of the algorithms. Run `make` in each algorithm directory to build the test client(s).
- Unit test suites for each of the algorithms and data structures. These are written in the [Unity Test framework](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity). To run the tests, simply call `make` from the `tests` directory.
- My solutions to the Java programming assignments from the Coursera series based on the textbook ([Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1), [Part II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2)).
