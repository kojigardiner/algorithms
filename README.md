# Algorithms, Fourth Edition by Sedgewick and Wayne

This repository contains the following:
- C implementations of the algorithms detailed in the Algorithms 4th ed. textbook by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne. The textbook implementations are in Java, and I found porting them to C offered a chance to better understand their details. Some of the algorithm implementations include test clients inspired by the textbook.
- C test suites for the algorithms above. These are written in the [Unity Test framework](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity). To run the tests, simply call `make` from the `tests` directory.
- My solutions to the Java programming assignments from the Coursera series based on the textbook ([Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1), [Part II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2)).
